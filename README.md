### Notes ###
The exercise is not hard, but I should had confirmed if the POST and DELETE mocks if it's related to the actions
required on the available actions of the app that I had to build.
Since it's not possible to execute those actions using a local json file (at least I don't know unless if I use a
node.js server) I assumed that was to replicate those actions using localStorage, in order to be able to add and delete
items from the list.
I got some problems with the tests since I don't have to much experience and I took some time to implement them, even so
they could be stronger, that's why I took more time to finish the exercise.
I'm not fully happy with the delivered code because for example the form validation it's not the best one, the same
applies to some of the template that should had been broken in smaller components, but in order to not delay even more
the delivery I sending it the way it is.

Thank you
